Swarm Tweaks
============

This plugin includes several tweaks to the WordPress default settings and
minor improvements I can't live without. I got sick of adding a bunch of
bulky plugins with all their own branding. It relies exclusively on the Graphene
theme, which I rely pretty much exclusively on.

Tweaks
------

* Replace WordPress logo in login page with site header image

* Add a simple maintenance mode

* Add a simple sitewide alert

* Disable footer vanity credits

* Remove a bunch of blingy widgets

* Change image link default to "None"
